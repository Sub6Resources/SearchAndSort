# SearchAndSort
A tank game to demonstrate various searching and sorting algorithms for UVU CS-1410.

This was developed in Jetbrains Rider. Opening the project and selecting the default run configuration should allow you to run without any problems.

Alternatively, download the mono command-line tool and run the exe found in the releases tab of this GitHub repository with `mono -v SearchAndSort.exe` (Yes it works fine on Mac)
